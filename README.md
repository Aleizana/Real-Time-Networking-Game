# Real-Time-Networking-Game
## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource and reference for all the things I learned as I worked on this Real-Time Networking and Game Programming project. This repository contains my journey in mastering networking and distributed systems 
concepts in software development. Using a template videogame called "Omega Race" and the Lidgren Network Library, I covered a range of topics from TCP/UDP socket programming to advanced techniques in real-time applications and emerging networking 
technology trends.

## Learning Objectives
### Core Learning Goals

    TCP/UDP Socket Programming: Develop the skills to implement robust TCP/UDP socket programming, enabling communication between applications over a network.

    Serialized Data Structures: Learn the art of serializing data structures for efficient network transmission, ensuring seamless communication between distributed components.

    Deterministic Data-Driven Flow: Create applications with a deterministic data-driven flow, enhancing predictability and control in distributed systems.

    Lobby Services Communication: Understand the components and effectively communicate with lobby services, a fundamental aspect of networked applications.

### Networking Fundamentals and Emerging Trends:

    Bandwidth Compensation Techniques: Implemented techniques such as dead-reckoning and estimation to compensate for bandwidth limitations in real-time applications.

    Research on Emerging Networking Technology Trends: Developed the ability to research and comprehend the impact of emerging networking technology trends, staying at the forefront of the field.

    Consistency and Replication: Explored the nuances of achieving consistency and replication in distributed systems, crucial for ensuring reliability and fault tolerance.

    Software Architecture: Gained insights into software architecture principles, focusing on designing scalable and maintainable distributed systems.

    C# Basics: Brushed up on essential C# basics, providing a solid foundation for implementing networking concepts in the C# programming language.

    Protocol Internals: Understand the internals of protocols, delving into the details of how communication is structured and managed in distributed systems.

## Final Thoughts
In this project, I learned that efficient network communication is a lot like a well-oiled machine that requires maintenance and structure to effectively run on both ends. You need structure to know where and how things went wrong. You need to be able to
understand the "Level 0" and the "Level 5" of your project to know how to do maintenance, and as far as the Game Programming aspect goes, you need to be able to write code that is optimized and clear. That is what I learned from this project, and I have
a much deeper appreciation for networked games and software design as a result. 

## Large Update With a Heavy Focus on Design Patterns Coming Soon!!
